This is a template for Adobe Photoshop that allow you to modify only 18 tiles to get a complete set of 50 tiles.

! NOW WITH LIVE PREVIEW !

I Hope it will be as intuitive as i expect :

Juste double-clic on the layer in the "Edit here" folder, edit them, save, back to the base template and everything will be updated !

Don't forget to comment if you like it ;)
